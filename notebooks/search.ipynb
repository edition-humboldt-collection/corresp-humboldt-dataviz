Thus, in addition to the table representing the various letters held by the selected institution, the information from the research aid is also displayed. Although the precise details have not yet been digitally indexed, it is nevertheless possible to get an overview of the number and type of documents that were kept in this institution. \n",

Thus, where possible, it is indicated more precisely what type of document and in what quantity the results contain."
